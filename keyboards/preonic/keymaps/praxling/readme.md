# praxling's modified layout - largely based on the default preonic layout

For Dvorak, the locations of the semicolon and single quote are swapped to match the modified Programmer Dvorak layout (http://programmer-dvorak.appspot.com/)
There are three layers that have been added to the default layout:
    - MOUSEKEYS: mouse navigation using the keyboard
    - NUMPAD: numpad on the right side of the keyboard
    - HYPER: has numbers on the home row, each enclosed with HYPR(kc) modifier key; used for desktop switching

Make example for this keymap:

    make preonic/rev3:praxling:dfu-util
